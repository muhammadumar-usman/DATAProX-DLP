Step 2: Manually Create the Tables
Stop the Flask server if it is currently running.

Open a Python shell inside your project environment and run the following commands to manually create the tables:

bash
flask shell


Inside the shell, run the following Python code:


python
from app import db, app
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()  # This will create all the tables, including the 'violation' table



This ensures that the Violation table is created in the SQLite database.

Step 3: Verify the Tables
To verify that the tables were created, you can use the following code in the shell to inspect the database schema:



python
from sqlalchemy import inspect
inspector = inspect(db.engine)
print(inspector.get_table_names())  # This should return a list of tables, including 'violation'



If 'violation' appears in the output, the table has been successfully created.
